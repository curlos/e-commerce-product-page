## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - React CSS Framework
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Learned how to use ChakraUI and reinforced local storage management.

### Continued development

This small project is complete. I will continue to use ChakraUI in future React projects and this was good practice for a more complex e-commerce site.

### Useful resources

- [ChakraUI Docs](https://chakra-ui.com/) - This helped me understand how to use ChakraUI. My approach was to write out the same code I saw on the docs and then play around with the different props and classes to see how it worked exactly.
